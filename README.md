We are interested in the performance of the mean square error of the holdout data as a function of and . One way to achieve this is to plot the contour of the mean square error of the holdout data as a function of and . Discuss the relationship between Elasticnet and L2, L1 regularization?
(1.g) (bonus +10) The question is can we do something else and yet achieve the same regularization effect? One way to accomplish this is via data augmentation technique. The data augmentation technique that we study consists of 4 steps:
